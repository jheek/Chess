# Chess
Personal project to play around with C++ and AI. Supported on both macOS, Windows and Linux. 
Uses the SFML library for the graphic interface. The goal for this personal project is twofold:
1. To gain a better understanding of c++ and how to use it in it's full potential. 
2. To challenge myself in creating an as-smart-as-possible AI that can beat all my chess-rivals!
